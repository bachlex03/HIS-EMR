# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves setting up a robust backend application using the NestJS framework. The backend will serve as the foundation for a full-stack application, providing RESTful APIs, proper project structure, and essential development tools. The setup should follow NestJS best practices and include necessary configurations for development, testing, and production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly structured NestJS backend application, so that I can build scalable and maintainable server-side functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend setup is complete THEN the system SHALL have a valid NestJS project structure with src/, test/, and configuration directories
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL run on a configurable port (default 3000)
3. WHEN the application is accessed THEN the system SHALL respond with a health check endpoint
4. IF the application encounters startup errors THEN the system SHALL log meaningful error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want essential NestJS modules and dependencies installed, so that I can leverage the framework's core features immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL include @nestjs/core, @nestjs/common, and @nestjs/platform-express dependencies
2. WHEN development tools are needed THEN the system SHALL include TypeScript, Jest, and ESLint configurations
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading in development mode
4. IF dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript configuration and build tools, so that I can write type-safe code with modern JavaScript features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript files are compiled THEN the system SHALL use strict type checking
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL generate optimized JavaScript output
3. WHEN development mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide source maps for debugging
4. IF TypeScript errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear compilation messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want basic API endpoints and middleware configured, so that I can start building application features immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL expose a root endpoint returning application status
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL include CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
3. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log HTTP requests and responses
4. IF invalid requests are made THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testing infrastructure in place, so that I can write and run unit and integration tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL run Jest test suites successfully
2. WHEN test coverage is generated THEN the system SHALL provide detailed coverage reports
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL support testing HTTP endpoints
4. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear failure messages and stack traces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment configuration management, so that I can easily manage different settings for development, testing, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN different environments are used THEN the system SHALL support .env files for local development
3. WHEN configuration is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe configuration objects
4. IF required configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with descriptive error messages
